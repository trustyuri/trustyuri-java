trustyuri-java
==============

This is a Java library to generate and check _trusty URIs_ (previously called
_hash-URIs_). Trusty URIs contain cryptographic hash values that can be used to
verify the respective content.
See https://github.com/trustyuri/trustyuri.


Examples
--------

See the [examples](src/main/resources/examples).


Usage
-----

The easiest way to use this library in your project is to let Maven download it from The Central
Repository. Just include the following lines in your `pom.xml` file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.trustyuri</groupId>
      <artifactId>trustyuri</artifactId>
      <version>1.17</version>
    </dependency>


Build
-----

Maven is required to build and run this library:

    $ mvn clean install


Run from Source
---------------

Run the following command to check a file or URL with a trusty URI:

    $ scripts/CheckFile.sh [FILE-OR-URL]

The following command adds a hash to a local file using module `FA`:

    $ scripts/ProcessFile.sh [FILE]

To transform an RDF document, use this command (the second argument is optional):

    $ scripts/TransformRdf.sh [FILE] [BASE-URI]


Run from JAR File
-----------------

Alternatively, you can generate a single JAR file with the following command
(the JAR file will show up in `target/`):

    $ mvn compile assembly:single

Or you can download a prebuilt JAR file:
https://github.com/trustyuri/trustyuri-java/releases

Then you can use the same commands as in the `scripts/` directory as follows:

    $ java -jar trustyuri-1.12-jar-with-dependencies.jar [COMMAND] [ARGS]

For example:

    $ java -jar trustyuri-1.12-jar-with-dependencies.jar CheckFile http://trustyuri.net/spec/v1.FADQoZWcYugekAb4jW-Zm3_5Cd9tmkkYEV0bxK2fLSKao.md
